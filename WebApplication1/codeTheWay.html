    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Code the Way facilitates the collaboration of schools, companies, and nonprofits to: (1) Offer students advanced computer science training and real-world job experiences working on projects that benefit nonprofits; (2) Increase certified computer science teachers; and (3) Contribute to the technology talent base.
        Code the Way model includes:
        Student access to real-world job experience – In addition to an advanced course that may earn post-secondary credits, students get experience working collaboratively on a project that benefits a nonprofit, culminating in a presentation to business leaders.
        Companies are part of the solution – Companies invest in education, make technology more accessible to nonprofits, offer their employees a meaningful volunteer experience, and contribute to the talent pipeline.
        Increasing certified computer science teachers – Support and training for computer science teacher certification increases the availability and quality of high school computer science programs.
